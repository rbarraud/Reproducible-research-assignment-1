## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
# read frmom csv file in working directory
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# re-format dates
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
data$date <- strftime(data$date, "%d-%m-%Y")
head(data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day:
```{R}
library(plyr)
daily_totals <- ddply(data[,1:2], .(date), colwise(sum))
head(daily_totals)
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day:
```{R}
hist(daily_totals$steps, main="Histogram of steps per day", xlab="Steps per day")
```

Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day:

```{R}
mean_steps <- mean(daily_totals$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_steps
median_steps <- median(daily_totals$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).

```{R}
# calculate mean steps per interval
interval_means <- ddply(data, ~interval, summarise, mean_steps=mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE))
head(interval_means)

# plot average steps throughout the day
plot(interval_means$interval, interval_means$mean_steps, type = "l", xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Mean steps")
```

Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{R}
interval_means[which.max(interval_means$mean_steps),]
```

## Imputing missing values
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{R}
# replace NA values with mean steps for that interval across all days
data$steps[is.na(data$steps)] <- interval_means$mean_steps[match(data$interval[is.na(data$steps)],interval_means$interval)]
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day:
```{R}
# re-calculate the daily totals
daily_totals <- ddply(data[,1:2], .(date), colwise(sum))
head(daily_totals)

# show in a histogram
hist(daily_totals$steps, main="Histogram of steps per day", xlab="Steps per day")
```

Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day:
```{R}
mean_steps <- mean(daily_totals$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mean_steps
median_steps <- median(daily_totals$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median_steps
```

Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?  
*The  median has changed, but the mean has stayed the same.*

What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?  
*No impact.*

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

```{R}
# get days of the week
data$date <- as.Date(data$date, "%d-%m-%Y")
data$day <- weekdays(data$date)

# replace day of the week with ether “weekday” or “weekend”
data$day <- sub("(Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday)", "Weekday", data$day)
data$day <- sub("(Saturday|Sunday)", "Weekend", data$day)
data$day <- as.factor(data$day)
```

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{R}
# calculate average interval steps on weekends and weekdays
library(dplyr)
day_interval_means <- data %>% group_by(day, interval) %>% 
    summarise(mean_steps = mean(steps))

# plot line graph on two panels
library(lattice)
xyplot(mean_steps ~ interval|day, 
    data = day_interval_means,
    type = "l",
    xlab = "Interval",
    ylab = "Number of steps",
    layout=c(1,2))
```
